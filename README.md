redux-db provides a normalized [redux](http://redux.js.org) store and easy object management.

## Why

Having a normalized state is a good strategy if your data is nested in different ways. The redux documentation has a nice explanation [here](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/reducers/NormalizingStateShape.html).

## How

```javascript
import db from "./schema";
 export const dbReducer = db.combineReducers(
    (session, action) => {
        const { BlogPost, Comment, User } = session;
         switch (action.type) {
            case "POSTS_FETCH_DONE":
            case "POST_FETCH_DONE":
            case "POST_UPDATE":
            case "POST_INSERT":
                // all these actions may be handled using just one statement.
                // the upsert method accepts both single objects and arrays.
                // the payload is automatically normalized and related tables are also updated.
                 BlogPost.upsert(action.payload);
                break;
             case "POST_DELETE": {
                const { id } = action.payload;
                const post = BlogPost.get(id);
                 post.comments.delete(); // Could be skipped if cascading deletes are defined.
                post.delete();
                 // or just, BlogPost.delete( id );
                break;
            }
            case "COMMENT_UPDATE":
            case "COMMENT_INSERT": {
                // assuming payload contains {id,post,author}
                const { post } = action.payload;
                 BlogPost.get(post).comments.add(action.payload);
                // or just, Comment.upsert(action.payload);
                break;
            }
            case "COMMENT_DELETE": {
                const { id } = action.payload;
                Comment.delete(id);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
);
```

## Dependencies

* none

## Performance & size

redux-db uses internal indexes to speed up lookups and is quite fast at the current state. However, optimizing performance and build size is a high priority forward. Current size is small, only ~5K minified and gzipped.

## Credits

This project is inspired by libraries such as [normalizr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/normalizr) and [redux-orm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-orm). redux-db is however a complete rewrite and only lends it's basic consepts.
